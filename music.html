			I completed my Bachelor of Science in Music at MIT in June 2023. My primary musical activities include composing, conducting, and playing the trumpet. I currently play with the La Jolla Symphony Orchestra and the UCSD Chamber Orchestra. I was previously the director of the MIT IAP Orchestra (2023) and the principal trumpet of the Cambridge University Orchestra (2023&ndash;2024). My compositions have been performed by various groups including San Diego New Music and the Carmel Valley Middle School Wind Ensemble.

				<h1>Theory and Composition</h1>
				
				<p>I started composition in middle school at the encouragement of my music teachers. Ever since then, I have enjoyed writing new pieces of music to share with the world. You can find some of my compositions here: <a href="./composition.html">Compositions</a>.</p>

				<p>As part of the requirements to fufill a music degree at MIT, I wrote an analytical paper: <a target="_blank" href="./papers/tchaikovsky_revisions_of_early_works.pdf">Tchaikovsky's Revisions of Early Works</a>. For this paper, I was awarded the Austin Kelly III Essay Prize for the best (research) essay in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.</p>

				<h1>Performance and Conducting</h1>

				<p>I was the director of the MIT IAP Orchestra for the 2023 season. The IAP Orchestra was founded in the Fall of 2012 by Daniel Zhang to give MIT students the chance to perform in an orchestra during Independent Activities Period (IAP) under the baton of a student conductor. In Winter 2023, the orchestra performed Anton&iacute;n Dvo&rcaron;&aacute;k's Symphony No. 8. The concert was February 3, 2023 at 8pm, at Kresge Auditorium. A recording can be found here:</p>

				<p>Other recent conducting engagements include leading members of the MIT Symphony Orchestra (MITSO) in pop-up concerts for Campus Preview Weekend and a reading session. I have also served as cover conductor in rehearsal for MITSO.</p>

				<p>I currently perform with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ljsc.org/">La Jolla Symphony Orchestra</a> and the UCSD Chamber Orchestra. Previously, I was the principal trumpet of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cmp.cam.ac.uk/opportunities/entry/cambridge-university-orchestra/">Cambridge University Orchestra</a> and a member of the Cambridge University Trumpet Ensemble for the 2023&ndash;2024 season. Before that, I have also been in the trumpet sections of the <a target="_blank" href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-symphony-orchestra/">MIT Symphony Orchestra (MITSO)</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercuryorchestra.org/">Mercury Orchestra</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stern-reuben.com/boston-orchestra-book-club">Boston Orchestra Book Club</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mitspo.org/">MIT Summer Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. Many of past performances with the MIT Symphony Orchestra can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://mta.mit.edu/multimedia/view">here</a>. I was also part of an MIT Summer Wind Quartet that I formed in 2023.</p>

				<p>At the end of my time at MIT, I was awarded the Laya and Jerome B. Wiesner Student Art Award in recognition of contributions to the MIT musical community: as a trumpet player in the MIT Symphony Orchestra, as the leading force in the revival of the IAP orchestra, and as an emerging composer and conductor. <a target="_blank" href="https://arts.mit.edu/wiesner-student-art-award-2023/">Award notice posted here.</a></p>
