		<section>
			<h1>Theory and Composition</h1>
			
			<p>I started composition in middle school at the encouragement of my music teachers. Ever since then, I have enjoyed writing new pieces of music to share with the world. You can find some of my compositions <a href="./composition.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>As part of the requirements to fufill a music degree at MIT, I wrote an analytical paper: <a target="_blank" href="./classes/tchaikovsky_revisions_of_early_works.pdf">Tchaikovsky: Revisions of Early Works</a>.</p>

			<h1>Performance and Conducting</h1>

			<p>I am currently the director of the MIT IAP Orchestra. The IAP Orchestra was founded in the Fall of 2012 by Daniel Zhang to give MIT students the chance to perform in an orchestra during Independent Activities Period (IAP) under the baton of a student conductor. This term, the orchestra is performing Anton√≠n Dvo&rcaron;&aacute;k's Symphony No. 8. The concert is February 3, 2023 at 8pm, at Kresge Auditorium.</p>

			<p>I am currently in the MIT Symphony Orchestra trumpet section (Fall 2019, Spring 2022&ndash;present). Many of our past performances can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://mta.mit.edu/multimedia/view">here</a>.</p>

			<p>A sample recording (Mussorgsky/Ravel <i>Pictures at an Exhibition: VI. Samuel Goldenberg und Schmuyle</i>) on piccolo trumpet can be eventually be found here.</p>
