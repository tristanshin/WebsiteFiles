		I completed my Bachelor of Science in Music at MIT in June 2023. My primary musical activities include composing, conducting, and playing the trumpet.

		<section>
			<h1>Theory and Composition</h1>
			
			<p>I started composition in middle school at the encouragement of my music teachers. Ever since then, I have enjoyed writing new pieces of music to share with the world. You can find some of my compositions here: <a href="./composition.html">Compositions</a>.</p>

			<p>As part of the requirements to fufill a music degree at MIT, I wrote an analytical paper: <a target="_blank" href="./papers/tchaikovsky_revisions_of_early_works.pdf">Tchaikovsky's Revisions of Early Works</a>. For this paper, I was awarded the Austin Kelly III Essay Prize for the best (research) essay in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.</p>

			<h1>Performance and Conducting</h1>

			<p>I am currently the director of the MIT IAP Orchestra. The IAP Orchestra was founded in the Fall of 2012 by Daniel Zhang to give MIT students the chance to perform in an orchestra during Independent Activities Period (IAP) under the baton of a student conductor. This past term, the orchestra performed Anton&iacute;n Dvo&rcaron;&aacute;k's Symphony No. 8. The concert was February 3, 2023 at 8pm, at Kresge Auditorium. A recording can be found at <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/43LZjmLSOvA">https://youtu.be/43LZjmLSOvA</a>.</p>

			<p>Other recent conducting engagements include leading members of the MIT Symphony Orchestra in a pop-up concert for Campus Preview Weekend (Haydn 88, Mendelssohn <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>) and a reading session (Beethoven 5).</p>

			<p>In the Summer 2023 season, I played trumpet for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercuryorchestra.org/">Mercury Orchestra</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.stern-reuben.com/boston-orchestra-book-club">Boston Orchestra Book Club</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mitspo.org/">MIT Summer Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. I also formed a wind quartet at MIT for the summer.</p>

			<p>I was recently in the MIT Symphony Orchestra trumpet section (Fall 2019, Spring 2022&ndash;Spring 2023). Many of our past performances can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://mta.mit.edu/multimedia/view">here</a>.</p>

			<p>At the end of my time at MIT, I was awarded the Laya and Jerome B. Wiesner Student Art Award in recognition of contributions to the MIT musical community: as a trumpet player in the MIT Symphony Orchestra, as the leading force in the revival of the IAP orchestra, and as an emerging composer and conductor.</p>
