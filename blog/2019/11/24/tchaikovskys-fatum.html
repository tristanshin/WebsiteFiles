<h1>Tchaikovsky's Fatum</h1>

<p>A relatively unknown piece of music, and one of my favorite pieces, is Tchaikovsky&#8217;s <em>Fatum</em>, Op. 77 (published posthumously). Tchaikovsky composed the tone poem in 1868, very early in his career. While its premiere was perceived as a success, the second performance came with less delight. As Balakirev (to whom the piece is dedicated) wrote, &#8220;There wasn&#8217;t much applause &#8230; The seams show, as does all your clumsy stitching.&#8221; Tchaikovsky regretfully destroyed the score in response. Three years after Tchaikovsky&#8217;s death, researchers pieced together the orchestral parts to restore the score and published it.</p>

<p>There are snippets of <em>Fatum</em> in Tchaikovsky&#8217;s later works — he directly used the lyrical part in his opera <em>The Oprichnik</em> — but perhaps his work on <em>Fatum</em> indirectly influenced his future writings. I was listening to the <em>Swan Lake</em> finale recently when I was reminded of this poem. The use of the full brass section from 8 before rehearsal 21 to rehearsal 23 (the buildup before Odette&#8217;s death and Siegfried&#8217;s subsequent suicide) has parallels to sections of <em>Fatum</em>. The brassy chords accompanied by short descending phrases* right before rehearsal 21 share characteristics to many parts of <em>Fatum</em>, and other techniques such as building tension by repeating a note in different octaves appear in both <em>Fatum</em> and the finale. Combinations such as whole tones resolving to a major chord, or a moving brass line which pushes to the next phrase, also appear in both pieces.</p>

<p><font size="2">*I&#8217;m not sure if this has a more official name, so I gave this a nickname of &#8220;sirens.&#8221;</font></p>

<p>At the conclusion of both works, Tchaikovsky throws a wrench into our ears by changing the main theme from minor to the parallel major, signifying a triumph over some evil force. In <em>Fatum</em>, Tchaikovsky seems to indicate that fate will drive everything towards a natural resolution, but the <em>Swan Lake</em> ending represents more of a resurrection of sorts as Odette and Siegfried ascend into the sky.</p>

<p>Perhaps this provides a different framework with which to analyze <em>Swan Lake</em>. Tchaikovsky&#8217;s frequently-used theme of fate seems to be embodied in the patterns that he uses repeatedly, especially the specific ways in which he uses brass. Maybe Tchaikovsky is indicating a subtle theme of fate lurking under the ballet?</p>
