<p>One semester down, seven to go. Wow, how fast time passed.</p>

<p>Things this semester were generally enjoyable. From classes, to the community I found, to seeing several high school friends when they visited/when I visited them â€” I found that my aggregate experience was quite positive. I think this exceeded my expectations, although that may not have been a very high bar. Going into college felt intimidating at first, which may have led to such low expectations. But I feel like by the middle of the semester, I realized how much I could get out of everything if I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.</p>

<h2>Classes</h2>

<p>I took 5 classes this term, 4 of which were math.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>18.217: Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics (Yufei Zhao)</strong>
		<br>
		This class was a graduate course surveying important results in extremal graph theory, graph structure and randomness, graph limits, additive combinatorics, and sumsets. Professor Zhao&#8217;s lectures were quite thorough and well-organized as to provide motivation and context for the results. Some powerful tools we learned and applied in this class include SzemerÃ©di&#8217;s regularity lemma, graphons, and Fourier analysis. This was my favorite college class I have taken (including five at UCSD) due to a combination of instructive lectures, challenging problem sets, and interesting assignments. Shoutout to Milan Haiman and Carl Schildkraut for helping me a lot in this class ðŸ™‚
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>18.410 (also 6.046): Design and Analysis of Algorithms (various)</strong>
		<br>
		MIT&#8217;s second course in algorithms, this class was designed to be entirely math-based with no programming. I think the class was fine overall; it taught me a lot more about algorithms than I knew before. There is a surprisingly high amount of math content in this class.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>18.701: Algebra I (Mike Artin)</strong>
		<br>
		MIT&#8217;s introductory algebra course, aptly titled &#8220;Algebra I&#8221; â€” what a throwback to <s>middle school</s> the first obstruction to my high school graduation requirements! This class covered group theory (mostly finite) and treated linear algebra through group theory. There was a nontrivial amount of Euclidean geometry in the class, something I wasn&#8217;t quite expecting. Also, this was my third time learning linear algebra, each in a slightly different context. I still don&#8217;t understand the spectral theorem, though ðŸ˜¦
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>18.A34: Mathematical Problem Solving (Yufei Zhao)</strong>
		<br>
		One of MIT&#8217;s &#8220;first year advising seminars,&#8221; this class focused on problem solving and communication of mathematical ideas. This class also acts as MIT&#8217;s Putnam Seminar, in which we prepared for the only math contest of the year. Classes were structured so that we were lectured on Wednesdays about a topic, assigned homework problems to do in the next few days, and presented solutions to them on the following Mondays. I tried to present as often as I could. Professor Zhao gave us useful tips on how to present math clearly in order to get the main ideas across. He also gave us chocolates on the last day ðŸ™‚
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>21M.301: Harmony and Counterpoint I (Jonathan Russell)</strong>
		<br>
		MIT&#8217;s second course in music theory. I already knew the material because of theory classes with my piano teacher when I was younger, but Dr. Russell was an amazing teacher so I enjoyed the class anyway. This course comes with an hour-long piano session and hour-long singing class each week. In my piano classes, I learned Chopin <em>Nocturne</em> Op. 72 No. 1 and Tchaikovsky <em>The Seasons</em> Mvmt. 10 &#8220;October: Autumn Song&#8221;. My final project was a quartet for violin, viola, cello, and piano. Not sure if it&#8217;s meaningful enough to share in public, but feel free to ask me for a copy of the score if you want. It wasn&#8217;t too fantastic or anything because I rushed the composition of the ending when I realized my deadline was earlier than I had previously thought ðŸ˜›
	</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended up getting As in every class except Graph Theory and Additive Combinatorics (GTAC), in which I got an A-. I was actually quite surprised that I got an A- in GTAC; even after I got all my scores I was afraid I would have been in the B or C range. It ultimately doesn&#8217;t matter because MIT puts their first years on &#8220;Pass/No Record&#8221; (PNR for short) in our first semester. Essentially, this maps an A, B, or C to a P on the transcript, and a D or F to nothing on the transcript (the class does not show up on the transcript). I intended to use PNR to see how hard of a workload I could take. To me, it felt like the workload was a bit on the hard side, meaning I should relax the load. I was surprised that my grades didn&#8217;t exactly reflect this â€” for example, if I had taken the next music theory class or a harder math class instead of 18.701, I might&#8217;ve gotten lower grades but still passed everything. But alas the semester is done and I took the classes I did, so there is nothing to be done about it.</p>

<h2>August-September</h2>

<p>Orientation was not too exciting to me. I know many people had fun with Residential Exploration (REX) events and Greek life rushing, but I mostly found myself hanging with friends for parts of orientation and not caring too much about the scheduled events. I took two &#8220;advanced standing exams&#8221; (ASEs) during this week, though I initially signed up for many more. I passed both, earning me credit for calculus and the intro programming class.</p>

<p>During orientation, I met visiting professor Kasso Okoudjou, who is my first year advisor, and professor Yufei Zhao, who leads the Putnam Seminar for first years (I had been placed in the Putnam Seminar a few weeks before). With the help of my friends and advisor, I selected my subjects for this term: 18.217, 18.701, 21M.301, and 24.02: Moral Problems and the Good Life (Kieran Setiya). I choose 24.02 partially because it is a CI-H, meaning that it satisfies one of the writing requirements for graduation.</p>

<p>I also settled into my living community for the year â€” Next House 4W. Through the Next House room lottery, I got a sizable single. This wing has a good number of people who had participated extensively in math competitions before (including double-digit numbers of MOPpers and National MATHCOUNTSers). Our wing also loves to play <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> on the Switch. There are a few non-residents who come over often too (notably Jason Chen, Rionna Flynn, and Jeffery Li).</p>

<p>Before classes started, I auditioned for MITWE and MITSO (our Wind Ensemble and Symphony Orchestra, respectively) and got in to both. I ultimately joined MITSO, under the direction of guest director Evan Ziporyn. Several of my friends also joined MITSO, including Vincent Huang, Lauren Li, and Colin Tang.</p>

<p>Then classes began and things start to get busy. The very first day, I decided to be a bit brave and do the entire 18.701 PSet even though it was due a week later. This cost me a decent amount of sleep. Then right before I went to sleep, the fire alarm went off. Well, good thing my sleep wasn&#8217;t disturbed!</p>

<p>A few days into the semester, I was hanging out in a lounge when I was intrigued by Ashley Lin, Jeffery Li, and Katie Wu working on the first 18.410 PSet about complexity recurrences and the divide-and-conquer method. After working on the PSet with them for a bit, I decide that it&#8217;s worth it to join the class. So I drop 24.02 (which meets at the same time) and take up 18.410 instead, bringing me to four math classes.</p>

<p>Club applications started early and hit hard. I wasn&#8217;t ready when clubs started to have competitive applications merely a week into school. As a result, I didn&#8217;t apply to a few clubs that I was interested in. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be better-prepared for next year. At least HMMT had their staff applications a bit later, so I applied to be a Chief Proctor for HMMT. I got the position, so now I work in the HMMT Schedules team.</p>

<p>Two weeks into school, I went on a first year retreat organized by some of the dorm staff. We had a puzzle hunt and discussed some aspects of life as a college student. I did a lot of reflecting on the first few weeks at college at this retreat and actually went offline from Messenger for the duration of the retreat. My health also became really weird this weekend as I got several mosquito bites, got the flu, and also had hiccups for almost two days straight. All were eventually resolved, so all was fine.</p>

<p>Near the end of the September, I had my first project assignment of GTAC. I had to take lecture notes for one of the classes and type it up in a handout/book format to be added to a collective set of lecture notes which would eventually be turned into a small book. The lecture I took notes for was on SzemerÃ©di&#8217;s regularity lemma. I already take all of my math notes on TeX, so it was not too hard to complete the assignment. But the first PSet of the class was due at the same time, so I was swamped with work this weekend. But the end result was quite rewarding and I am quite pleased.</p>

<p>By the end of the month, I stopped attending lectures for 18.410 and 18.701. I personally felt like I could learn just the same by reading lecture notes or the textbook for these two classes, allowing me to stay up later in the night and sleep in more. I think this was a good decision that benefited me throughout the rest of the semester.</p>

<p>This month, I struggled a bit socially as groups started forming. Sometimes, it felt as though cliques were solidifying and it was hard to find my footing at times. Coming in, I thought that everything would be like MOP again. Maybe it&#8217;s my memory that&#8217;s hazy, but I didn&#8217;t get nearly the same feeling. I quickly found that I had my close friends scattered a bit through different settings for the most part. Just as I had felt during senior year of high school, most of my closest friends were at a different place. There was still plenty of time to change that, though.</p>

<p>Other notable events:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Went to the New England Aquarium during orientation; did a puzzle hunt there and enjoyed looking at aquatic creatures
	</li>
	<li>
		Went to Harvard a few times to visit friends; got a Harvard library card
	</li>
	<li>
		Joined Next House&#8217;s intramural basketball team
	</li>
	<li>
		Enrolled in the badminton class to get PE credit; learned how to play
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>October</h2>

<p>The academic month started with my first tests of MIT â€” 18.701, then 18.410 shortly after, then 21M.301 a few days after that. I had a few errors in 701 (after failing to shake off the morning sleepy feeling) but lenient grading got me a perfect score. My 301 test was also fairly easy.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t fare as well on the 410 test though, getting a 76/120. It was still fine though, as the average was in the 40s meaning that I scored well above average. However, one of the lecturers did not think this was satisfactory as he emailed me saying that first years in the class should excel. He recommended dropping the class and taking it later once I am more prepared. He then requested to schedule a meeting.</p>

<p>I also noticed that I was marked off for a problem which I thought I had completely solved, so I requested a regrade. This ended up boosting my grade to 86/120. Then I went into my meeting with the lecturer, where he reiterated that I should be excelling in the class. I reasoned that I will do well enough in the class and pushed on.</p>

<p>I attended the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) for the first time, seeing Yuja Wang perform Shostakovich&#8217;s Piano Concerto No. 1. The trumpet section was good but not excellent. I couldn&#8217;t feel the same brilliance of the bell as I usually do when listening to top trumpet sections. But the whole orchestra was very good, making me excited to go to more concerts.</p>

<p>Speaking of music, MITSO had our first performance and it went reasonably well. Some of the music was a bit unconventional though, but the concert seemed to go fine.</p>

<p>I also went apple picking as part of an organized trip from a few dorms. I spent most of the time with Andrew Gu as we found our way through rows and rows of apples. A pretty good time overall. Eventually, a combination of my experiences here, at the first year retreat, and walks on the Harvard Bridge/Charles River culminated in some musical ideas which may be coming soon to a piece near you ðŸ˜®</p>

<p>During October, social things started picking up more. I found a good mix of time spent in groups as well as time with individuals outside of group settings. I went out and did things with friends besides just hanging out in dorms â€” such as getting lunch/dinner, going on walks, etc. But I still felt a few moments of social loneliness, or at least more than I would&#8217;ve liked. Sometimes it was unclear in what direction my friendships were going. A reflection of some of these events in my life prompted me to choose the aptly-titled October movement from Tchaikovsky&#8217;s <em>The Seasons</em> as my next piano piece.</p>

<p>Other notable events:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Saw the beautiful Charles River Esplanade on the aforementioned walk with a friend
	</li>
	<li>
		Saw Harvard Bach Society Orchestra (BachSoc) perform Beethoven 7
	</li>
	<li>
		Finished the badminton class and enrolled in the beginner ice skating class
	</li>
	<li>
		Went to McDonalds a few times with Alan Zhu and Jason Chen to get the PokÃ©mon Happy Meal toys
	</li>
	<li>
		Family came to town for Family Weekend
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>November</h2>

<p>The first day of November is a special day in the world of college applications. The arrival of deadline day this year reminded me of the difficult few weeks I had last year, in which early deadlines came at the same time as 4 band performances, OMO Fall, and exams at both high school (finals) and UCSD (midterm). I guess I wasn&#8217;t prepared when the busy feeling brought on from those weeks would be replicated throughout the entire month of November. I had energy-draining activities all throughout the month, leaving me hopeful for the end of the semester.</p>

<p>Early in the month, HMNT happened (that&#8217;s not a typo â€” the N stands for November). A combination of events made my job harder throughout the day, but we eventually got through the competition day with everything looking fine. I was quite pleased with my contributions to the tournament. A GTAC PSet was due the same weekend though, so I struggled to finish in time. I ended up submitting the PSet incomplete and a day late, deducting several points from my grade.</p>

<p>The next weekend was a trip to Princeton to help with PUMaC. I was in the grading room for the whole contest day, helping to grade parts of Power Round and Individual Finals (including the bary/coord bashes). I also spent some time visiting Abigail McRea and remembering how beautiful the Princeton campus is. The trip was quite enjoyable, though our bus from New York to Boston was delayed with complications.</p>

<p>Around this time I also had my second wave of tests. 701 went well again with another perfect score. 301 was a little trickier this time but still fine. This time for 410, I got a 115/120 (after a regrade because my unusual max flow reduction was erroneously marked incorrect). I&#8217;ll admit that the second unit being heavily focused on math (most ideas were about graph theory or linear programming) helped my score quite a bit.</p>

<p>The following weekend, I had the second MITSO concert of the year, a weekend of teaching for MIT Splash, and a GTAC PSet due. The MITSO program was almost entirely made up of unconventional music for a classical orchestra, and the concert goes less well than expected. A combination of factors about the orchestra and my ideas for second semester compel me to leave MITSO for the next term. I will probably reevaluate this decision at the end of second semester based on how things go next term.</p>

<p>I taught two classes for MIT Splash â€” one about wind instruments in classical music and another about the proof of the hook length formula. The music class goes well and I get a bit of engagement from the students, but the math class quickly goes downhill. I realize now that the proof of the hook length formula is perhaps not best suited to be squeezed into a 50-minute Splash class. Once again, time runs out on the GTAC PSet as I submit late and incomplete yet again.</p>

<p>Then came Thanksgiving. I was relieved to finally have a break from the constant onslaught of schoolwork. I did have an assignment for GTAC due at the end of break, but that could wait a few days. A few friends from my grade at CCA had came to Boston to visit for Veterans Day a while back, but now a large group came for a Boston Thanksgiving meetup. Over the few days of break, various subsets of our group:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Ate Thanksgiving lunch at Santouka Ramen
	</li>
	<li>
		Went on a tour of Harvard led by us (non-Harvard students)
	</li>
	<li>
		Ate a small Thanksgiving dinner at Next House (they decorated my door whiteboard!)
	</li>
	<li>
		Went Black Friday shopping on Newbury Street
	</li>
	<li>
		Went Black Friday shopping at Natick Mall
	</li>
	<li>
		Walked around a lake at Wellesley
	</li>
</ul>

<p>The time spent with my friends from high school made me actively miss being around them. I usually don&#8217;t have that sort of feeling towards groups, knowing that I&#8217;ll still be a part of something. But this time it was something different. Maybe it&#8217;s because the separation had outlined the group in my mind. Maybe it&#8217;s because of the stark contrast between my idealized vision of a social life and what I usually find, and how these few days were an approximation of what I expected. But the weekend made me happy, for all the right reasons.</p>

<p>I saw the BSO twice this month â€” first for Mitsuko Uchida&#8217;s performance of Ravel Piano Concerto and later for Daniel Lozakovich&#8217;s performance of Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. Both also had one Shostakovich symphony; his 12th for the first concert and his 2nd for the second one. The Shostakovich 12 was quite enjoyable (especially the finale) as were the soloist performances.</p>

<p>Overall, the constant academic work, extracurricular activities, and social interactions this month made me look more and more forward to winter break.</p>

<p>Other notable events:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Saw Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra (HRO) perform Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with soloist Alex Zhou (he was <em>really</em> good)
	</li>
	<li>
		IM basketball season ended with a 2-3 record (including 2 wins and 1 loss by forfeit)
	</li>
	<li>
		Quit ice skating class after lingering ankle injury made it impossible to ice skate
	</li>
	<li>
		Parents came to town for Thanksgiving break
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>December</h2>

<p>On the last day of Thanksgiving break, with most people gone from visiting, I sat down and cracked away at the second project assignment of GTAC &#8212; write a [high quality] Wikipedia article on something related to the class. I had initially chosen to write my article about quasirandom graphs, but a different group had already done that. So instead I chose Sidorenko&#8217;s conjecture. After several hours of research and reading of the important papers in the field, I produced the following Wikipedia article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidorenko%27s_conjecture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidorenko%27s_conjecture</a>. I learned quite a lot from the project, not only about homomorphism density inequalities but also about how to put together a useful small exposition. Once again, a very rewarding project which makes me glad that I took the class.</p>

<p>Early in the month, I had a special event which required me to go to Medford. Travelling there requires taking the Red Line to Downtown Crossing, switching to Orange Line, and taking it to Wellington. The Station Landing right outside Wellington station is quite expansive, with the neighboring stores being the usual deal. I spent the evening at a Starbucks there, writing some music as well as reflecting on the first semester. It was fun to go somewhere besides Cambridge area to just sit down and think. I might do more adventuring around the area in the future.</p>

<p>The Putnam also took place on the first Saturday of the month. I solved A125B15, which is a bit lower than expected. In particular, my struggles on &#8220;Problem 1&#8221; returned as it took forever to find one of the constructions for A1. I think it is a psychological thing which causes me to struggle with the first problem of Olympiad contests. At least contests have a lot less significance now, so the effect is less important.</p>

<p>I also take the last 701 test, on which I get an 87/100 this time. I struggled a bit with this unit as I knew less of it beforehand, so I could not complete all of the problems on the test. It is overall fine though, as I believe that I adequately learned the content of the class through the PSets and tests.</p>

<p>During the last week, I went on a dorm-organized trip to Boda Borg, a &#8220;quest center&#8221; which includes several quests that are similar in nature to small escape rooms. I spent most of the time there on a team with Ashley Lin and Andrew Lin. We participate in many quests, most memorably one which featured motivational phrases spoken by a narrator. Awesome!</p>

<p>Then classes wrapped up and I presented my final project for music. The performance didn&#8217;t go completely smoothly as I butcher the piano part, but I thought my score was good so I was satisfied. We concluded GTAC with a few more ideas that connect things from all throughout the class. Putnam Seminar ended with a discussion of the Putnam and some chocolates. I meant to attend the final 701 lecture, but Artin cancelled it. I skipped the last 410 lecture because I was preparing for my music presentation. And just like that, classes for first semester are over.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my classes this term. I got more than expected out of each of my classes and learned some interesting content. That&#8217;s one of the things I was really hoping to get out of college, so it&#8217;s quite good that I was able to experience this right off the bat. I am quite excited for my classes next term, which (if registration goes well) includes three music classes.</p>

<p>During a short break before finals week, I visited Harvard for the last time this semester, taking a rest and change of scenery for a few hours. The break was also the perfect time to play Overcooked (2), mostly with Jason Chen and Andrew Gu. I got pretty <em>overhooked</em> on the game and look forward to playing it more during IAP ðŸ™‚ I also learn that a handful of people from CCA got accepted to MIT early, which excites me as I&#8217;ll hopefully be seeing them around soon.</p>

<p>Then I take my only final of the semester, for 410. I completely whiff on one problem, not even knowing what Luby&#8217;s algorithm is, but I manage to get a 160/180. While the result is really good, it still disappoints me a bit to know that if I had been more careful about checking work and also actually studied Luby&#8217;s algorithm, I could&#8217;ve gotten near-perfect. But alas the academic semester ends on that note.</p>

<p>Other notable events:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Got an Echo Dot because of Black Friday/Cyber Monday deal; also got a Google Home Mini for free from Spotify
	</li>
	<li>
		Conducted a group for the first time since the DanzÃ³n No. 2 surprise
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concluding remarks</h2>

<p>As I started spending more time with specific individuals, I started realizing how much I didn&#8217;t need the notion of a &#8220;social group&#8221; as much as I thought. I had such a social group in high school, and I thought I would come back to one after a three year hiatus from MOP. But I found that if I didn&#8217;t rely on the notion of a social group but instead appreciated it, and appreciated the individuals and subsets who I was close with out of the group, I could enjoy my social life better.</p>

<p>This semester, I really got into Mahler&#8217;s symphonies. Before this year, I had studied Mahler 5 extensively for trumpet reasons (though my favorite movement is the Adagietto which, ironically, has no trumpet). But this term I listened to Mahler 2, 3, 6, and 9 a lot more. I&#8217;ve also listened to the others at least once this semester. There&#8217;s a certain richness to the orchestration and harmonization which Mahler utilizes that gives his symphonies their brilliance and beauty. He is also one of the Romantic era composers who really use wind instruments for their specific qualities, writing for each instrument with deliberate intent. I think Mahler joins Tchaikovsky and Chopin in my mind as my favorite composers.</p>

<p>Wiki knows Treasure Island. Wiki knows the legendary ship. And he can guide you to the magical destination. How do you know that you&#8217;ve arrived though, if you&#8217;ve never heard of it? If you don&#8217;t even know what it is?</p>

<p>So, Wiki, tell me â€” what <em>is</em> Treasure Island? What brilliance are you bringing us to at the end of our journey? I hear of riches, I hear of comfort, I hear of security and knowledge. And I know that if you guide us to riches, nobody will bat an eye when you claim that we have arrived. And we will be none the wiser when we are done, without an understanding of what our final destination is.</p>

<p>So, what <em>is</em> Treasure Island?</p>

<p><em>[no response]</em></p>

<p>Well then, I guess a journey begins!</p>
