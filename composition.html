			<h1>Music Composition</h1>
			
			<p>I started writing small bits of music in middle school at the encouragement of my music teachers, culminating in a concert march for the school wind ensemble composed and conducted by myself. Since then, I have written several pieces ranging from piano shorts to orchestral works. I enjoy combining a variety of techniques from different musical forms with a desire to capture distinct characteristics in my works. Often motivated by the emotions and energy of people around me, I strive to give special personalities to all of my music.</p>

			<p>My composition instructors at MIT include Peter Child, Keeril Makan, Charles Shadle, and Jonathan Russell.</p>

			<h2>Selected Compositions</h2>

			<p><b><i>Stress</i> for String Quartet</b> (2023)</p>

			<p>"The title of the quartet is not an indication of how the piece feels as much as how the composer felt while writing the piece."</p>

			<p>Score available <a target="_blank" href="./scores/stress_string_quartet.pdf">here</a>. Recording by the Del Sol Quartet available soon.</p>

			<p><b>Rhapsody in D</b> (2022), commissioned by San Diego New Music. World premiere July 27, 2022.</p>

			<p>Rhapsody in D is an adventure from one musical location to another. There are several statements of music that build on each other, creating new ways to think about the same ideas. We enjoy many types of music scenery, including a rhythmic introduction and a series of reflections. Ultimately, the piece is a celebration&mdash;a celebration of musical forms, abilities, and spirit. The opening is marked "Moderato giocoso," which sets the tone as playful and cheerful. The work as a whole pulls at various emotions at times but always points back towards the opening giocoso section, celebrating the music that follows. This piece was commissioned as part of the San Diego New Music Emerging Composers Commission.</p>

			<p>Score available upon request. Recording by San Diego New Music.</p>

			<p><b>Tragic Prelude</b> (2021)</p>

			<p>The Tragic Prelude musically asks a question that repeatedly gets interrupted by wandering thoughts. Whether the ending is truly a resolution to the question is left unclear, but all of the energy that has built up by the insistence of the question has been shattered, almost tragically. This piece was written for a project in MIT 21M.304, part of the theory and composition sequence.</p>

			<p>Score available <a target="_blank" href="./scores/tragic_prelude.pdf">here</a>. Recording by Eileen Huang.</p>

			<p><b><i>Allegro con vivo</i> from Piano Sonata in F</b> (2021)</p>

			<p>This is the first movement of a three-movement piano sonata (in progress). This movement was written for a project in MIT 21M.304, part of the theory and composition sequence.</p>

			<p>Score available <a target="_blank" href="./scores/piano_sonata_in_f_mvmt_1.pdf">here</a>. Recording by Eileen Huang.</p>
