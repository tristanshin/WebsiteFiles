		This page lists some other of my activities, including hobbies, projects unrelated to math/music, and other adventures ðŸ™‚

			<h1>Minecraft Speedrunning</h1>

			<p>One of my hobbies is Minecraft speedrunning, where I go by the username tssal. This started out as a low-key fun activity when I was stuck at home in 2020 but eventually turned into something that I became more competitive about. I upload my runs to my gaming YouTube channel: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@tssal_game">https://www.youtube.com/@tssal_game</a>.</p>

			<p>I mainly run 1.16 Random Seed Glitchless (the most popular category) and Half% (get half, or 40, of all of the advancements). I also occasionally play 1.15 Random Seed Glitchless (the trading version), Icarus (where you can fly using wings), and PogLoot (where loot rates are boosted).</p>

			<h1>NBA Playoffs Bracket Challenge</h1>

			<p>Every year, I run a fun bracket challenge among my friends, with a unique scoring formula that incorporates predicted series winners, number of games for series, and statistical leaders. Currently, the bracket challenge is run in a small-scale operation, but I have plans to make the process a bit more online in the near future.</p>
