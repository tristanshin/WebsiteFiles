			When I'm not doing things related to math or music or hanging out with friends, I can usually be found doing one of my hobbies (possibly with friends). For the most part, this means one of basketball, Legos, video games, and walks.

			This page lists some other of my activities, including hobbies, projects unrelated to math/music, and other adventures &#x1F642;.

				<h1>Minecraft Speedrunning</h1>

				<p>One of my hobbies is Minecraft speedrunning, where I go by the username tssal. This started out as a low-key fun activity when I was stuck at home in 2020 but eventually turned into something that I became more competitive about. I upload my runs to YouTube (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@tssal_game">tssal_game</a>) and occasionally stream on Twitch (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/tssal31">tssal31</a>).</p>

				<p>I mainly run 1.16 Random Seed Glitchless (the most popular category) and Half% (get half, or 40, of all of the advancements). I also occasionally play other categories, which can be found on my channel. I also sometimes compete in MCSR Ranked, a 1v1 speedrun race system.</p>

				<p>Update Spring 2025: I don't play this nearly as much as I used to, so many stats and rankings are very low compared to what they used to be.</p>

				<h1>NBA Playoffs Bracket Challenge</h1>

				<p>Every year, I run a fun bracket challenge among my friends, with a unique scoring formula that incorporates predicted series winners, number of games for series, and statistical leaders. Currently, the bracket challenge is run in a small-scale operation, but I have plans to make the process a bit more online in the near future.</p>
