		I am currently working on my Master of Advanced Study in Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge (Part III of the Mathematical Tripos), expecting to finish in June 2024. Previously I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at MIT in June 2023. My mathematical interests primarily lie in extremal combinatorics, algebraic combinatorics, analytic number theory, and harmonic analysis.

		<section>
			<h1>Research</h1>

			<p>In Summer 2023, I worked on a project about sieve theory. Specifically, we studied the decomposition of certain sums into parts based on prime factorization structure. These sums show up when analyzing prime gaps using the Selberg sieve.</p>

			<p>In Spring 2022, I worked on a project about Schubert polynomials and the symmetric group. This stemmed from a <a target="_blank" href="https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/drp/">Directed Reading Program</a> project about Manivel's book on symmetric functions.

			<p>In Summer 2020, I participated in the MIT Math Department's <a target="_blank" href="https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/urop-plus/">UROP+ program</a>, working on the probability theory of a model of branched polymers. As part of the program, I wrote a paper explaining the some of the work that we did: <a target="_blank" href="https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/urop-plus/documents/2020/Shin.pdf">On the space of planar branched polymers with fixed tangency graph</a>.</p>

			<h1>Contests</h1>

			<p>I am/was involved in organizing a handful of math competitions:
			<ul>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmmt.org/">HMMT</a>, as a former Tournament Director (Season 25, 2021-2022)</li>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.arml.com/">American Regions Mathematics League</a>, as a member of the problem writing committee</li>
				<li>Online Math Open (now defunct), as a problem writer, a software manager, and a communications manager</li>
				<li>and several more (CCA Math Bonanza, San Diego Online Contest, etc.)</li>
			</ul>
			As part of these, I wrote many problems at various difficulty levels. A small archive of some of them can eventually be found <a target="_blank" href="./TArchive.pdf">here</a>.</p>

			<p>I used to participate in math competitions, but that was way back in the day.</p>

			<h1>Teaching</h1>

			<p>I was a recitation instructor/teaching assistant for 18.01: Calculus I under Larry Guth in Fall 2022. My subject evaluations can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://eduapps.mit.edu/ose-rpt/subjectEvaluationSearch.htm?termId=&departmentId=&subjectCode=&instructorName=Shin%2C+Tristan&search=Search">here (requires MIT certificate)</a>.</p>

			<p>I have also taught/managed at various programs, including the following:
			<ul>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://web.evanchen.cc/mop.html">USA Mathematical Olympiad Program</a> (Instructor, 2023; Lead Teaching Assistant, 2021; Teaching Assistant, 2020)</li>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sdmathcircle.org/">San Diego Math Circle</a> (also as a coach for the ARML and HMMT teams)</li>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://alphastar.academy/math-summer-camp/">A<sup>*</sup> Summer Math Camp</a> (Academic Coordinator for the foreign exchange program)</li>
				<li><a target="_blank" href="https://ccamathteam.wordpress.com/">Canyon Crest Academy Math Team</a> and Epsilon Summer Series (President)</li>
			</ul>
			Some of the handouts that I developed for these programs can be found <a href="./handouts.html">here</a>.</p>
